 * This function is in some respects a mirror image of the core function
 * pathkeys_useful_for_merging: for a regular table, we know what indexes
 * we have and want to test whether any of them are useful.  For a foreign
 * table, we don't know what indexes are present on the remote side but
 * want to speculate about which ones we'd like to use if they existed.
 *
 * This function returns a list of potentially-useful equivalence classes,
 * but it does not guarantee that an EquivalenceMember exists which contains
 * Vars only from the given relation.  For example, given ft1 JOIN t1 ON
 * ft1.x + t1.x = 0, this function will say that the equivalence class
 * containing ft1.x + t1.x is potentially useful.  Supposing ft1 is remote and
 * t1 is local (or on a different server), it will turn out that no useful
 * ORDER BY clause can be generated.  It's not our job to figure that out
 * here; we're only interested in identifying relevant ECs.
