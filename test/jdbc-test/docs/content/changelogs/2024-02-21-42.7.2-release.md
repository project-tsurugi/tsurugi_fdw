**Notable changes**


### Security
* security: SQL Injection via line comment generation, it is possible in `SimpleQuery` mode to generate a line comment by having a placeholder for a numeric with a `-`
  such as `-?`. There must be second placeholder for a string immediately after. Setting the parameter to a -ve value creates a line comment.
  This has been fixed in this version fixes [CVE-2024-1597](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1597). Reported by [Paul Gerste](https://github.com/paul-gerste-sonarsource). See the [security advisory](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-24rp-q3w6-vc56) for more details. This has been fixed in versions 42.7.2, 42.6.1 42.5.5, 42.4.4, 42.3.9, 42.2.28.jre7. See the security advisory for work arounds.
